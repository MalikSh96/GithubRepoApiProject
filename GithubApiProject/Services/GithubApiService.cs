                The reason for using the "using" statement is to make sure the the object is disposed 
                as soon as it goes out of scope. The "using" keyword tells the compiler that the variable 
                being declared should be disposed at the end of the enclosing scope.
                Dispose() is called during "garbage collecting" (manages the allocation and release of memory).
                Dispose() is a method that is present in the IDisposable interface.
                "using" makes sure that Dispose is called once we are done with the object.
                Improves performance.
